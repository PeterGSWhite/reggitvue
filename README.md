# reggitvue
At it's core this is a simple CRUD application with a user model, registration and login. <br><br>
The posts being CRUDed (if that's a word) are snippets of RegEx, and there is a built in preview window of the snippets in action.<br><br>
This repo is for the Vue front end.<br><br>
The backend is a Rest API built with Django Rest Framework.<br><br>
